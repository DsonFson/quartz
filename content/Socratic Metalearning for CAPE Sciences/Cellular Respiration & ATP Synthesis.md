# Cellular respiration 
- Cellular respiration is the process by which energy in food is converted into the energy for an organism to do biological work, using glucose as the main respiratory substrate. 
- From glycolysis to Krebs cycle glucose and its derivative substrates  mostly  under go oxidation. Consequently, electron carriers (such as FAD+ and NAD+)  are reduced.  These electron carriers are important because energy is harvested from them in oxidative phosphorylation (final step in aerobic respiration). ATP provides the energy for the metabolic processes in respiration. It does this by transferring phosphate groups to other molecules. This process is called phosphorylation
- Respiration in aerobic conditions can be divided into four stages:
	1. Glycolysis
	2. Link reaction (pyruvate oxidation)
	4. Oxidative phosphorylation (ETS - electron transport system)
