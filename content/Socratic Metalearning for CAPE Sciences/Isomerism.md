# Isomers

- Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms 

- Chain isomerism is possible because carbon atoms can branch 

- There are two main types of isomerism: Structural Isomerism & Stereoisomerism

- Stereochemistry is the study of the shapes of molecules and the relationship between their component atoms and groups in two and three dimensions 

- In stereoisomerism isomers differ in geometric and optical appearance 

- Stereoisomerism occurs only in compounds with double bonds. 

- The two type of stereoisomers are cis isomers and trans isomers. If two groups attached to the chiral carbon are on the same side of the double bond, the isomer is a cis isomer. If the two groups lie on opposite sides of the double bond, the isomer is a trans isomer. (trans - across, cis - adjacent)

- Stereoisomerism arises due to restricted rotation about a double bond. The sp2 hybridized carbons are fixed in space relative to each other. 

- Optical isomers are described as being chiral molecules. 

- Conditions for optical isomerism to be possible 
	1. a  central carbon atom has 4 different groups attached to it 
	2. The  isomers are mirror images of each other 
	3. The isomers are non-superimposable on each other 

- Compounds which possess optical isomerism are called enantiomers. All enantiomers are chiral compounds with 4 substituent sp3 groups. 

- When you look at an enantiomer in a solution, you can see that they rotate the plane of polarization of plane-polarized light in opposite directions. 

- The enantiomer that rotates the plane to the right (clockwise)/left (counterclock wise) is called dextrorotatory/levorotatory

- An enantiomer will not rotate plane polarized light in solution if it both isomers (dextrorotatory/levarotatory) are equimolar in solution (1:1) . In this case, it is called a racemic mixture. (Think of it as left cancelling out right.

- In determining if a compound is chiral, 2 things you must look for is 
	1. No bisecting plane (unique substituent groups) 
	2. No possible superimposable mirror image. 

- Chiral compounds are analysed using this procedure: 
	1. Plane-polarised light pass through a tube containing a solution of optical isomers
	2. Plane of plane-polarised light is rotated then passes through the analyser
	3. Analyser is rotated until the light passes through, and extent and direction of rotation is determined
	4. If chiral, there would be two recorded rotations of plane-polarised light in equal amounts but in opposite direction 


- When looking at alkanes, it is often easy to confuse their conformations with their isomers. 

- Conformations occur when atoms or groups connected by σ bonds can rotate around the σ bond to assume different  arrangements in space relative to each other,

- The types of structural isomerism are 
	- Chain isomerism - different length of carbon chain (branched)
	- Functional group isomerism - different functional group.
	- Position Isomerism - functional group in a different position.
