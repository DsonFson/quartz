# Isomers

- Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms 

- Chain isomerism is possible because carbon atoms can branch 

- There are two main types of isomerism: Structural Isomerism & Steroisomerism

- Sterochemistry is the study of the shapes of molecules and the relationship between their component atoms and groups in two and three dimensions 

- In stereoisomerism isomers differ in geometric and optical appearance 

- Stereoisomerism occurs only in compounds with double bonds. 

- Stereoisomerism arises due to restricted rotation about a double bond. The sp2 hybridized carbons are fixed in space relative to each other. 

- Optical isomers are described as being chiral molecules. 

- Conditions for optical isomerism to be possible 
	1. a  central carbon atom has 4 different groups attached to it 
	2. The  isomers are mirror images of each other 
	3. The isomers are non-superimposable on each other 

- Compounds which possess optical isomerism are called enantiomers 

- When you look at an enantiomer in a solution, you can see that they rotate the plane of polarization of plane-polarized light in opposite directions. 

- The enantiomer that rotates the plane to the right (clockwise)/left (counterclockwise) is called dextrorotatory/levorotatory

- An enantiomer wll not rotate plane polarized light in solution if it both isomers (dextrorotatory/levarotatory) are 1:1. In this case, it is called a racemic mixture. (Think of it as left canceling out right 

- When looking at alkanes, it is often easy to confuse their conformations with their isomers. 

- Conformations occur when atoms or groups connected by σ bonds can rotate around the σ bond to assume different  arrangements in space relative to each other
