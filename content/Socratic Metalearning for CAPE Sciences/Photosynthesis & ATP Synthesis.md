# Photosynthesis & ATP Synthesis 

## ATP

- ATP is suitable as the universal energy currency because 
	- The conversion from ATP to ADP + energy is a o**ne-step reaction** and so minimizing energy cost
	- ATP is **easily hydrolysed** to form ADP + energy
	- ATP is **recycled** from  ADP. Since ADP is easily phosphorylated there is constant supply 
	- ATP is **small** so it easily moves in the cell
	- ATP is **soluble**, making it suitable for metabolic reactions 
	- Each ATP molecule releases a **large amount of energy** 
- By considering the chemical structure of ATP explain why its bonds are easily broken?
	- It has three electronegative groups. These repel each other, forming unstable covalent bonds. It takes low activation energy to break the phosphate group link.
- 30.5 kJmol-1 of energy is released for the first two phosphate groups then 14.2 kJ mol-1 energy }}  for the removal of the final phosphate
- The synthesis of ATP from ADP is called phosphorylation. It is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase/ATP synthetase.
- There are three types of phosphorylation
	- Oxidative phosphorylation
	- Photophosphorylation
	- Substrate-level phosphorylation

## Photosynthesis 

Photosynthesis consists of the light independent & light dependent stage. The light dependent stage is termed Photophosphorylation, and the light independent stage is termed Calvin Cycle.

## Photophosphorylation 

### Structure & location 

Photophosphorylation takes place in the thylakoid of the chloroplast. 

Chloroplast maximises the absorption of light because 
	1. the network of membranes within a chloroplast provides a large surface area.
	2. pigments absorb light and harvest energy 

- All of these pigment molecules make up the photosystem's large antennae complex. The Antennae complex is a light harvesting system formed from the accessory and primary pigments embedded in the thylakoid membranes. 
  
- The types of pigments found in chloroplasts are chloroplasts
	- chlorophyll a (P700)
	- chlorophyll b P680
	- accessory pigments (carotenoids) 

-  Account for the various pigments found in the chloroplast. What role does this play in photosynthesis?
	- Each pigment absorbs different wavelengths/parts of visible spectrum. When light strikes them they get energised and pass excited electrons onto chlorophylls; therefore plants are able to absorb a lot of light. 
- There are two types of photophosphorylation: cyclic photophosphorylation & non-cyclic photophosphorylation. They differ in terms of
	- 1. Photosystem (PS) used - PSI only is involved in cyclic photophosphorylation while both PSI and PSII are involved in non-cyclic phosphorylation
	- Reaction centre -  in cyclic absorbs light of wavelength 700nm while reaction centres in non-cyclic absorb light wavelength of both 700 nm and 680 nm 
	- Where electrons end up - In cyclic, electrons revert to PSI.  In non-cyclic electrons are accepted from PSI by PSII which transfers electrons to NADP

After Photophosphorylation, the products ATP & NADPH are transferred from the thylakoid into the stroma for the Calvin Cycle (light independent stage) 


### Process

- Photophosphorylation happens when an electron is passed along a series of electron carriers forming  an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membranes to cause the phosphate group to react with ADP. 

- What happens in the electron transport chain specifically that causes phosphorylation? 

	Excited electrons are transported from one electron carrier to the next in a series of redox-reactions. As the electrons move through these carriers they release energy in the form of H+ ions. This provides energy for the conversion of ADP to ATP. 


- Photophosphorylation comprises of these 3 main processes
	1. Electron Transport
	2. ATP Synthesis
	3. conversion of NADP+ → NADPH

 - Steps in Cyclic Photophosphorylation
 - Light absorbed by PSI  - accessory pigments pass energy to reaction centre (P700)  - Electrons @ reaction centre are excited & enter ETS -  release of energy creates steep H+ gradient (pump from stroma → thylakoid) - H+ ions diffuse down concentration gradient through ATP synthase, releasing energy (from H+)  to convert ADP to ATP - electrons transferred back to P700

- Process of non-cyclic photophosphorylation 
	- Light hitting PSII cause electrons to be emitted - electrons from PSII pass down Electron Transport Chain (ETS), generating ATP (as above) - electrons reenergised at PSI by light energy - excites electron pair -electron acceptor passes electrons to NADP (not reverted as in cyclic) - electrons replaced at PSII by electrons produced by splitting of H2O (photolysis) - oxygen expelled - H+ from  photolysis move outwards into the stroma to increase proton gradient

**NB.** The only key difference between the two is that in non-cyclic electrons transferred from PSII to PSI and then the formation of NADPH. Everything else is the same.
