# General formulae & Functional groups

- Alkanes - CnH2n+2
- Alkenes  - CnH2n
- Alcohols - CnH2n+1OH
- Carboxylic Acids - CnHn+1OOH
- Halo-alkanes - CnH2n+1X
- Ketones/Aldehydes  - CnH2nO
- Ester - COOR
- Amide - CONH2
- Amine - R-NH2

Aldehydes have a functional group $HC=O$

Ketones have a functional group $R{2}C=O$, where R is a hydrocarbon group 

The difference between Ketones and Aldehydes is that aldehydes have an H attached to one side of the carbonyl group and may have an 'R' group e attached to the other, but ketones have 'R' groups attached to either side of the carbonyl group.
