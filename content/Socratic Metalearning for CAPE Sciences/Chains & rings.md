# Chains & Rings


## Tetravalency 
 
- Tetravalency is the ability to form four covalent bonds </p> </details> 

- Activity in the carbon orbitals to form tetravalency

- Apart from bonding one-after-the-next, carbon atoms can also form branches and rings. 

- When a  hydrocarbon branches it changes its physical properties by increasing volatility and reducing density

## Resonance 

Resonance is a way of describing delocalised electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by a single Lewis formula. 

A resonance hybrid is a compound, molecule, ion, or radical exhibiting resonance and having a structure represented in the written form as the average of two or more structural formulas separated each from the next by a double-headed arrow 

## Bonding 

### Fusion

- **π bonds** result from  the extension of half-filled, **unhybridised** _p_ atomic orbitals which can overlap _side-on_ - perpendicular to the σ bond.

- Homolytic cleavage occurs when two electrons in a bond are divided equally between the products 

- Heterolytic cleavage occurs  when one atom gets both of the shared electrons

###  Fission (The breaking of chains)
- An organic compound is described as a radical when it has unpaired electrons with no net charge. It is formed by homolytic fission 

- An organic compound is described as an ion when it has a paired electrons with net charge. It is formed by heterolytic fission.

## Homologous series 

The Homologous series is a series of organic compounds that have the same functional group and differ from adjacent members by a (-$CH_{2}$) group
