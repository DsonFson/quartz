# Capacitors 

- A capacitor is a circuit component that stores charge between two metallic plates separated by an insulator (or a vacuum)
- Capacitance is the charge stored per potential difference across two plates. (Q/V)
- The unit for capacitance  is Farad (F)
- Capacitance and stored energy share this relationship: The greater the capacitance of a capacitor, the greater the magnitude of charge on either plate for a given potential difference; hence the greater the amount of stored energy. 
- The equations relating potential energy and capacitance
	- $U = \frac{1}{2}CV^{2}$, $U =\frac{1}{2}QV$, $U = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^{2}}{C}$
- Capacitance depends on two physical properties
	1. Area
	2. Length
	3. Nature of the dielectric (insulator)
- The equation for capacitance considering the area and length of dielectric is
	- $C=\epsilon_{0}\frac{A}{d}$
- The electrical permittivity of free space , $\epsilon_{0}$  is defined as 
	- The ratio of the charge stored with dielectric compared to without it. It tells us how well a material is at permeating an electric field. (don't confuse this with permeability of free space which is for [[Magnetic fields]]
- The electrical permittivity of free space has  value of 8.85x10^{-12) with units C^{2)N^{-1}m^{-2}
- Equation for energy stored in a parallel plate capacitor in terms of electrical field, E
	- Since U =
