# Ohm's Law & Derivations
- State Ohm's law
	- The current through a conductor is proportional to the potential difference across it, given a constant temperature
- IV characteristics 
- Cases
	- metallic conductor
		- Draw IV graph
			- ![[Untitled-2.png|250x250]]
		- Account for the shape of the graph 
		- A metallic conductor is ohmic; the current is directly proportional to the potential difference. 
	- filament lamp 
		- draw IV graph
			- ![[filament iv.png|250x250]]
		- Account for the shape of the graph
			- non-ohmic at high voltages but ohmic at small potential differences. 
			- Increased voltage causes increased rate of flow of electrons through the lamp. At higher speeds there are more collisions with atoms in the conductor. These collisions result in energy loss in the form of heat. 
	- semiconductor diode/Light-Emitting-Diode (LED)
		- Draw IV graph

			- What is the region D? 
			- What is the region B?
			- What is the voltage value, E?
			- Account for the steep rise in the graph beyond C?
			- What happens to the diode at A?
